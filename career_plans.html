					<h2>Commom elements</h2>
					<p>Talking about the similarities that we all need for our career plans, the first thing is to master our logical thinking and programming languages such as Python, C++, Java. We all need to learn about these both inside our university and online platform so that we can have the firm fundamentals. Furthermore, one more significant thing that we all have in common is other languages more than our mother tongue, so that we can work worldwide. Moreover, Quan and Tri desire to be game developers so that they will have some programming patterns. They may use some same applications such as Unity or Unreal Engine in this field. So, in the first few years, while learning in university and after graduating, Quan and Tri can have some common working aspects and they may work together. Lastly, on our upcoming road to the future plan, we may need many soft skills such as time management, teamwork, and appropriate behavior learning so that we can stay in a challenging working environment.</p>
					<h2>Differences in our career plans</h2>
					<p>Because our career plans are very various, ranging from AI, Machine Learning, Games, to Software Engineering, and Mobile Development. We can have a lot of differences in our own road but here we will just illustrate some major differences. These things can be learned at schools but some of them cannot. For example, Quan really needs to have a firm understanding of people management while Tri wants to open his understanding in 3D Graphics and some other languages. Huy should develop and enhance his foundations such as advanced Linux, HMI, and OOP to keep them up with the market trends and fit his company’s annual achievements meanwhile Duy may have some basic concepts about the Android OS and IOS. Kotlin, Java, and Objective-C obviously are needed here for him to start working on his career plan. Overall, the four of us maybe have unique roads to achieve, and inside this project, we can use our different knowledge to support each other and develop a super creative, colorful world inside the headset.</p>
					<h2>Our career plans across the group</h2>
					<p>To conclude, we all want to follow our dream and make it come true as desired as possible. So that, the basic things that we should focus on should be a stable understanding of what fields that we are pursuing, a bachelor’s degree, and self-learning soft skills. Besides, having years of enrolling in a real working environment can significantly improve our knowledge. For now, while studying in school, all we can do is try our best to learn from many sources, take advice from alumni and seniors, and be ready for our upcoming knowledge so that we can use that later in the future.</p>
