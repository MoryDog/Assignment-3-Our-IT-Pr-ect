                  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>My name is Nguyen Minh Quan, my student information is s3927181 and s392718@rmit.edu.vn and I am currently a first-year student at RMIT University, studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City. My family has 4 people but now, it is only 3 since my older sister is working abroad. I am really into playing games and finding out special mechanisms to learn more about how things work in the technology industry. In my daily routine, I usually play games in my free time. It is a good way for me to communicate with my old friends as we are in different schools now. After a hard-working day, there is nothing better than having fun with your mates. Besides, sitting in front of technological gadgets all the time is not good, that is why sometimes I go to the coffee store to hang out and meet people face to face. That is extremely great and feel at ease. About my IT interest, the first game that I played was Eden Eternal when I was 7 years old. However, my young age can not stop me from enthusiast games. From that moment, I played a lot of different games such as MOBA, Gacha, MMO. To me, games are not only for relaxing but also for training our soft skills and strategies that we can apply in real-life situations. Talking about my experience in the Information Technology field, I haven’t had much since I just started learning recently. Most of my knowledge is about Python and a bit of using terminals such as Git Bash or Shell.</p>

          <h2>My thoughs about the test results</h2>
          <p class="description-content">
            I found it suprising that the test results can be quite true about myself. Firstly, the Myer-Briggs test tells me that I am a logistician, which means that I can evaluate situations based on reality and the surrounding environment and there should not be emotional judgings. This can really help when my team needs to decide choices. Secondly, the Big Five test shows me that I am an open person while in a team since my Openness and Agreeable rates are high. I think that in a team, I will be the one who connects everyone together and solve conflicts. However, my weakness is Neuroticism, this percentage is high compares to other people who do the test so I assume that I will try to calm myself and try to be relaxed as much as possible so that my negative aura will not affect my team. Lastly, the learning test says that I am a tactile learner, which means that I have to practice a lot to master something. In my opinion, this trait at first will not have much value since I do not have any mastered skills or knowledge, but the longer I work or learn things, the greater outcome that I can make and contribute to my team.

          <h2>Ideal Job: Game Developer </h2>
          <div class="result-img-container"><img src="images/quan_job.jpg" /></div>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Job description </h2>
          <ul>
              <p>I want to become a director of game design. I have always wanted to create my own game since I was a child. The thrilling emotion I feel when I play any PvP Games, the excited or even upset moment when I play Gacha Games. All of these sparkled a fire in my mind about creating my own game. Thinking about my game in the future will be popular worldwide is the strongest hope, the source of the flame in my heart that keeps me work hard from the moment I played my first game. Director position means that I have much more responsibilities and controls with my games like small details, stories, characters and game balances, but that appears to be the only way to create my own games. If I work as a worker in companies, I will never achieve my dream because I always have to work for other people.</p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Job requirements </h2>

              <li>3+ years in people management experience.</li>
              <li>Experience creating systemic change to a design team's process or principles to improve the outcome</li>
              <li>Communicating complex and nuanced designs in simple ways.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Current skills </h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Basic knowledge in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Java and a fundamental grasp of object-oriented programming (OOP) design process.</li>

              <li>Friendly, hardworking and always ready to socialize with fellow teammates when doing projects.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Future development plan</h2>
          <p class="description-content">
            When I will have finished my bachelor’s degree at RMIT by 2024, I will look for a software company to practice my experience and learn more. After that, about 2027 – 2029, I believe that I have enough knowledge in Information Technology, I definitely want to find a game companies to dig deeper about this aspect. Besides, I think that I will pay more attentions to online competitions that are held by Riot or game-related company so that I can participate and challenge myself more. About 5-6 years later, I ensure that I will have been had enough experiences in game industry, I will try to apply for my dream position.
