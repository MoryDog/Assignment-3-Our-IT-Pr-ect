					<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					<p>My name is Hua Nam Huy. My student ID and email are s3881103 and s3881103@rmit.edu.vn.
						I come from Ho Chi Minh City – the largest city in Vietnam, and I’ve been studying Software Engineering at RMIT University on Saigon South Campus for 3 semesters.
						Playing video games with my pals, watching YouTube, and reading light novels are some of the things I enjoy doing in my spare time and recently I’ve been learning coding from online websites too.
						When I was young, My brother and I would often ask my grandpa for his permission to play some simple games on his work computer.
						In those days, the fun from playing games motivated me to become a video game developer when I grow up as I dreamt of playing a game that I created myself, but the advent of the Internet and social media altered everything.
						Following that, I learned that the field of information technology encompassed more than just games, and I developed an interest in learning more about IT and its applications in our world.
						I was curious as to how IT technicians and programmers made it so that whatever information you want to know is available at the click of a button, or how they managed to create a video game with moving characters and sound.
						This inspired my decision to become a software engineer and discover how the world of IT works through the use of lines of code.
						I've only had a little experience with programming languages like Python and C/C++ up until now, and as I finish my first year at RMIT University, I intend to enroll in additional courses to get more programming knowledge and expertise.
						I'd like to learn more about the Java and Python programming languages to help with my coding studies, as well as become acquainted with key software engineering ideas, patterns, and tools that would be required for my future career.</p>

					<h2>My thoughs about the test results</h2>
					<p class="description-content">
						I believe the tests are mainly true in terms of my personality, how I respond in social situations,
						and my learning style. The results revealed my strengths and faults, as well as recommendations for
						how to fix my flaws. While the test results may define me as an introverted person who prefers to
						tackle things on my own, I don't feel it would have much of an impact on my conduct because when
						you're part of a team, you must give your best and be a responsible teammate for the group to work properly.
						So, when building a team, I'd look for teammates with abilities and expertise that could compensate me for
						what I'm now lacking, and in turn, I'd aid my teammates with their problems by filling in for them utilizing
						my strengths. To that end, I'm always prepared to complete my task to the best of my ability,
						listen to others for advice on how to fix my mistakes, and to use my strengths whenever they're needed to help the team.
