          <h2>1. Aim</h2>
          <p>As mentioned above, the pandemic has rendered many of our daily services inaccessible and remote working has proven to be challenging for many professions. Therefore, a solution to improve the experience of those who work from home is
            required. Our vision for this project is to successfully design a VR headset system with an interactive and dynamic virtual environment that would be unaffected by changes in real-life settings, allowing individuals to work, learn, and
            relax more effective from home. To accomplish this, we would need to meet the following criteria :</p>
          <li><b>Ease of use</b> : The effectiveness and usability of a virtual reality system are the primary factors considered by users when deciding whether or not to adopt a new technology such as VR in their lives. Since we wanted to offer a
            device
            that people can easily use while they’re at home without any complications, it must be simple enough that they only need to do a few steps to be able to open and access the system. As such, it is important that we provide users with
            straightforward instructions and images on know how to set up the hardware such as sensors, controllers so the device will work correctly, as well as a virtual assistant AI that will accompany and guide the user when they’re inside the
            virtual environment to help them feel more familiar with the software and solve problems encountered when using any applications.</li>
          <li><b>Affordable</b> : One of the downsides to purchasing a VR headset is that they can be really expensive for higher end devices, ranging from 600 to 1000 USD per system . This is due to the fact that many headsets are made with
            high-quality materials and frequently incorporate cutting-edge hardware that would provide users with sophisticated capabilities such as greater resolution and more accurate motion tracking. So, in order to realize our goal of improving
            the efficiency and productivity of as many people as possible, we want our VR headset to be available at a fair price that is affordable to everyone without sacrificing too much on quality and features. Therefore, it is important that
            extensive research be conducted to identify suitable materials and components for building the hardware of our device.</li>
          <li><b>Solve remote working problems</b> : The transition from the office to working from home has undoubtedly been difficult and hard to adapt for many people during the pandemic. Therefore, the most important goal of our project is to be
            able to improve the experience of remote working and tackle difficulties that may arise, such as poor communication and the lack of access to services. Subsequently, we envisioned the VR headset to be a tool that would provide users with
            an interactive environment in which they could log in and talk directly with one another, making it simpler to communicate their ideas and opinions away from the restrictions of a computer screen. On top of that, users will have access to
            a plethora of tools applications rendered in 3D graphics to assist them in completing tasks faster along with the visualization of objects and data for better understanding of their work.</li>
          <h2>2. Plans and Progresses</h2>
          <p>...</p>

          <h2>3. Roles</h2>
          <p>After carefully discussing the upcoming project idea, we move to the division of the roles. In this part, the most important thing is that we have to equalize everyone’s contribution but also be able for our teammates to make use of
            their skills. Firstly, Quan and Tri can find all of the possible components on the Internet for the hardware, look for advice from professionals, or learn by themselves about the outline of the VR headset. To be more in detail, Quan may
            want to craft, beautify the component for aesthetic and that can attract more customers, or maybe he can also do the arrangement part so that all of the ingredients can link with each other within the minimum space cost. Tri, with his
            knowledge, it is easy for him to connect and conduct electrical wiring, check for electricity, safety, and validity of the wearer. Secondly, Huy and Duy will be in charge of the software technologies in this project. Huy can start with
            building up the prototype and scenes within the VR headset such as log-in screen, functional buildings, characters while Duy can take care of the hand movements of the controllers, wireless connections, and even the space photosensitive
            of the users.</p>
          <h2>4. Scopes and Limits</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Deliverables ( Scopes )</h3>
          <li>Basic functions</li>
          <br>
          <p>--- An immersive environment of the world will be designed as a small town with applications acting as real functional buildings such as hospitals, libraries, malls, and stadiums. Those places would be staffed with AI bots and avatars of
            real-life staff of these establishments to assist the user with their needs.</p>
          <p>--- Users can move around by gesturing with the hand-held controls.</p>
          <p>
            <li>A physical VR headset that is correctly operating with basic functionalities, which users can actually wear. </li>
            <li>A program that can generate a digital open world (research meta-verse).</li>
          </p>
          <h3>4.2 Non-Deliverables ( Limits )</h3>
          <li>The use for virtual training in numerous professions such as operating heavy machineries, pilot, driving, etc. </li>
          <li>Tracking body movement in space. The project is limited to tracking head and eyes movements only. </li>
          <li>Users are only able to immerse themselves into a recreational environment and cannot see real-time surroundings of real-life locations, as well as people. </li>
          <h2>5. Tools and Technologies</h2>
          <p>...</p>
          <h2>6. Testing</h2>
          <p>For this stage, we will be focusing on testing our project in order to find out bugs, run-time errors, physical errors, and glitches before we move on to any further implementation. First, we will do the software test, most of the
            compilers nowadays have debugged functions so this will not take long. The main problem here is the run-time errors, it is hard to find out and time-consuming. After this, we move to hardware testing. At this point, it is important for us
            to check that there are no redundant wires, no electrical leakages, and the headwear is suitable and comfortable with the wearer. After all, we will choose professional testers to wear this and experience this VR headset. Their job is to
            report back to us the feelings while wearing that headset, and any new errors. The next step for us is to carry on surveys and open a testing phase to a wider range. Besides, we will tell them to do some specific functions such as weird
            test cases, or even doing things when the Internet speed is super slow. However, they still can freely explore the new virtual world. More and more people who are interested in this headset can participate and give feedback. Lastly, we
            will fix and upgrade our project idea according to the feedback and the market trend.</p>

          <img src="images/risk5.jpg" alt="" class="center">
          <h2>9. Group communication and processes</h2>
          <p>Communication between teammates in a group is the most significant part while doing a team project. It is a fact that most of the failures happened because there was a misunderstanding in communication between people. Here, the main way
            that we talk to each other is through an online platform - Meeting in Microsoft Teams. We used this from the start of Assignment 2 until now, this is really helpful. Besides, we also use Messenger from Meta, Google Docs, Word, in order to
            save files and update, progress to each other. Regarding the frequency, our communication occurs at least once, and up to two times a week. In the meetings, we usually update our own processes to each other first, and then we start to
            talk about how well the overall report is. After that, we will discuss the unfinished parts and set fixed deadlines for them. This is to control the process and through this, we can easily keep track of everyone’s parts. In the upcoming
            week, which is week 12, we plan to have some offline meetings to practice our presentation as well as discuss some last parts of our Assignment 3 report. </p>

          <p>If a group member does not interact with the team on a regular basis, we will try to meet and chat with them directly to see if they are having any challenges at work or in their personal lives. If they're having trouble finishing a
            task, the team will assist them in resolving the issue and assign them to a less challenging duty. However, if a team member is having personal troubles and continues to refuse to communicate or contribute to the team, we will have no
            choice but to reduce their contribution to 0% and report it to the lecturer.</p>
