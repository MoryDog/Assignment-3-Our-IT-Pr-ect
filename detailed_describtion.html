          <h2>1. Aim</h2>
          <p>As mentioned above, the pandemic has rendered many of our daily services inaccessible and remote working has proven to be challenging for many professions. Therefore, a solution to improve the experience of those who work from home is
            required. Our vision for this project is to successfully design a VR headset system with an interactive and dynamic virtual environment that would be unaffected by changes in real-life settings, allowing individuals to work, learn, and
            relax more effective from home. To accomplish this, we would need to meet the following criteria :</p>
          <p>
            <li><b>Ease of use</b> : The effectiveness and usability of a virtual reality system are the primary factors considered by users when deciding whether or not to adopt a new technology such as VR in their lives. Since we wanted to offer a
              device
              that people can easily use while they’re at home without any complications, it must be simple enough that they only need to do a few steps to be able to open and access the system. As such, it is important that we provide users with
              straightforward instructions and images on know how to set up the hardware such as sensors, controllers so the device will work correctly, as well as a virtual assistant AI that will accompany and guide the user when they’re inside the
              virtual environment to help them feel more familiar with the software and solve problems encountered when using any applications.</li>
            <li><b>Affordable</b> : One of the downsides to purchasing a VR headset is that they can be really expensive for higher end devices, ranging from 600 to 1000 USD per system . This is due to the fact that many headsets are made with
              high-quality materials and frequently incorporate cutting-edge hardware that would provide users with sophisticated capabilities such as greater resolution and more accurate motion tracking. So, in order to realize our goal of improving
              the efficiency and productivity of as many people as possible, we want our VR headset to be available at a fair price that is affordable to everyone without sacrificing too much on quality and features. Therefore, it is important that
              extensive research be conducted to identify suitable materials and components for building the hardware of our device.</li>
            <li><b>Solve remote working problems</b> : The transition from the office to working from home has undoubtedly been difficult and hard to adapt for many people during the pandemic. Therefore, the most important goal of our project is to
              be
              able to improve the experience of remote working and tackle difficulties that may arise, such as poor communication and the lack of access to services. Subsequently, we envisioned the VR headset to be a tool that would provide users
              with
              an interactive environment in which they could log in and talk directly with one another, making it simpler to communicate their ideas and opinions away from the restrictions of a computer screen. On top of that, users will have access
              to
              a plethora of tools applications rendered in 3D graphics to assist them in completing tasks faster along with the visualization of objects and data for better understanding of their work.</li>
          </p>
          <h2>2. Plans and Progresses</h2>
          <h3>Hardware</h3>
          <h4>First 8 Weeks</h4>
          For the first two weeks of the project, we are going to sketch out the plans for the whole 16 weeks: how the progress will be going, what we should do for each week. These two weeks will be crucial as we need to determine a specific plan
          to work with in order to keep up the good efficiency, and since we only have 16 weeks, this project won’t be able to complete without a good, realistic plan in such a short amount of time. For week 3 to week 4, Tri and Quan will work on
          declaring what the hardware components for the headset are going to be, as well as looking for the material sources. With that being completed, we will move on to the next stage: start building a prototype. We plan to hire professionals
          to create some first models, as well as monitor the process as strictly as possible to ensure that no mistakes should occur. This is expected to be done from week 5 to week 6, or week 7 to be the latest. After the prototype has been
          built, we will use one or two weeks to do the test stage as we want to complete the trials before the end of week 8 so that we can move on to do other things for the project. Back to the test stage, we will pick out several volunteers,
          approximately 5-15 people, to try our headset, and then collect their feedback about the outlook and comfortability of the headset as well as its sensor, the connection between the wires, and the headset, and the synchronization between
          the controllers and the system.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Last 8 Weeks</h4>
          In the first eight weeks, we assume that we planned all the progress, the blueprints to start working on our project as well as we have already done most of the first design and prototype. So, in the last eight weeks, we need to make
          further developments to our VR Headset hardware. Here, we will discuss as a team and maybe take some outsiders’ suggestions to upgrade and expand our hardware. This progress will take approximately 2 weeks for us. For example, we will try
          to add some more functions such as an energy-saving switch, night light display onto the lenses. Whatever we are going to put onto our headset, we will try to keep them convenient, small as much as possible, and also, we will need to
          consider the feeling of the user while wearing this. Moreover, the safety of the user is significant, each of our components must be tested strictly about safety. Besides, we could add some fuses to stop the whole system if there is a
          problem happens such as an overload of electricity, or electrical leakage.
          <br>
          Moving to the next step after developing the hardware, we plan to do the overall testing of our hardware (including some basic functions from the Software part). This step will take us roughly 4 weeks. In this part, we will hire
          qualified testers to test our hardware and give feedback. We will give them a To-Do list and they can also explore freely our headset. Moreover, we also need to check the system manually and automatically every period of time to make sure
          everything will run smoothly. After the testers give us feedback, we will compose all of them, evaluate the priorities and then adjust or optimize according to the orders. However, only one or two testing phrases will not be enough. We
          will carry on many testing phrases with different ranges of people so that we can have an overall view and feedback.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Software</h3>
          <h4>First 8 Weeks</h4>
          <p>The most important thing to do during the first eight weeks of the software development process for this project is preparation, as this is a great opportunity to carefully think things through and ensure the positive outcome of the
            project. Firstly, the team needs to do research and gather all the required resources, which can be documents, tutorials, sample projects related to the targeted software that will be used, which focus mostly on Blender and Unity, as
            these are the most commonly used and widely supported. We will then proceed to discuss what features we would want to include in our VR system software and define the purpose of each feature to best suit our consumer needs. This
            preparation process is expected to go on for two weeks. The resources can be found through various sources on the Internet, in particular the official websites of the aforementioned technologies. </p>
          <p>
            <li>From week 3 to week 4, after having entirely collected the required resources, the team will now settle on the design of the virtual environment and figure out all possible problems that may arise during development and evaluate the
              feasibility of all functions that we have listed out so we can decide on which functions are necessary in order to keep our project at a manageable scale as we are a small team with a limited budget. </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Week 5 to 8 will be used to program the foundation of our software develop the first functional prototypes. During this phase, the team expects to have finished coding the backend parts of the software using Unity and put
              together a primitive version of the virtual environment, consisting of simple roads, paths, and a very simple outline of buildings and other infrastructure elements.</li>
          </p>
          <h4>Last 8 Weeks</h4>
          <p>In general, the final eight weeks will be spent thoroughly developing and finishing up the project's software-related components. Furthermore, the team will implement and test additional functionalities to improve accuracy and make the
            virtual environment appear more immersive and lifelike. This will be the most important time of our development process because the software will be the focal point of our project and we want to ensure that consumers can enjoy the virtual
            world without encountering any problems during their usage. </p>
          <p>
            <li>Week 9 - 10: Finalize paths and roads elements, with various types of pavements and sidewalks along with the scenery. Establish the general layout of the town and location of buildings so it can be convenient for users when they
              explore
              around.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Week 11 - 12: Settle on the exterior and interior design of buildings and implement the corresponding application for each building. Following that, we’ll start testing the functionality of each application to make sure they work as
              intended and fix any errors that may occur during operation.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Week 13 - 14: Start developing AI elements within each building and ensure that they can interact properly and provide users with assistance when they’re needed. After preliminary testing is completed, we will then proceed to enact
              cybersecurity protocols in order to maintain information security and the privacy of our customers.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Week 15 - 16: Wrapping things up, conduct final tests to make sure everything works correctly and to find out any hidden bugs in our systems. The final step would be to check the compatibility of our software and incorporate it with
              hardware controls.</li>
          </p>
          <h3>Distribution</h3>
          In the last 2 weeks, while doing the remaining progress after finishing our final products, the distribution will also take place. However, in order to start, we will need to find a fund. To be particular, we think that we will take
          place in the Shark Tank Viet Nam or Global so that we can demonstrate our project idea with the capital contributor and get the attention, not only from “ the Sharks “ but also from the viewers from all over the world, who are watching
          the show. Assumed that we succeed in this part, we will start the distribution of our product to the designed areas.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>3. Roles</h2>
          After carefully discussing the upcoming project idea, we move to the division of the roles. In this part, the most important thing is that we have to equalize everyone’s contribution but also be able for our teammates to make use of
          their skills. Firstly, Quan and Tri can find all of the possible components on the Internet for the hardware, look for advice from professionals, or learn by themselves about the outline of the VR headset. To be more in detail, Quan may
          want to craft, beautify the component for aesthetic and that can attract more customers, or maybe he can also do the arrangement part so that all of the ingredients can link with each other within the minimum space cost. Tri, with his
          knowledge, it is easy for him to connect and conduct electrical wiring, check for electricity, safety, and validity of the wearer. Secondly, Huy and Duy will be in charge of the software technologies in this project. Huy can start with
          building up the prototype and scenes within the VR headset such as log-in screen, functional buildings, characters while Duy can take care of the hand movements of the controllers, wireless connections, and even the space photosensitive
          of the users.

          <h2>4. Scopes and Limits</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Deliverables ( Scopes )</h3>
          <li>Basic functions</li>
          <br>
          <p> An immersive environment of the world will be designed as a small town with applications acting as real functional buildings such as hospitals, libraries, malls, and stadiums. Those places would be staffed with AI bots and avatars of
            real-life staff of these establishments to assist the user with their needs.</p>
          <p> Users can move around by gesturing with the hand-held controls.</p>
          <p>
            <li>A physical VR headset that is correctly operating with basic functionalities, which users can actually wear. </li>
            <li>A program that can generate a digital open world (research meta-verse).</li>
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Non-Deliverables ( Limits )</h3>
          <li>The use for virtual training in numerous professions such as operating heavy machineries, pilot, driving, etc. </li>
          <li>Tracking body movement in space. The project is limited to tracking head and eyes movements only. </li>
          <li>Users are only able to immerse themselves into a recreational environment and cannot see real-time surroundings of real-life locations, as well as people. </li>
          <br>

          </p>
          As our focus are more on the virtual environment inside the headset and the applications that will accompany it , we intend to use existing hardware components from other companies as the foundation for our project, which we will modify
          and enhance with additional outside features so that the hardware parts can match and work well with our software.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Software</h3>
          For software, in order to create the interface, we will be using Blender (version 3.0) and Unity (version 2021.2.7). Blender will be used to design 3D models such as buildings in the towns, characters, Virtual Reality environments, while
          Unity will be for developing the interface logic and movement. We can use some assets on the Unity to help us if those match our project idea. Additionally, a decent amount of knowledge in programming languages is required to make good
          use of the software engines listed above, specifically C# for Unity and C/C++, Python 3 for Blender. In addition, the firm fundamental of knowledge in programming is required in this such as OOP, functional programming, or even divide and
          conquer. As we are not working much on the hardware, we will put all of the effort into the software. Moreover, we can use Google Cloud or SQL in order to manage the database of our systems and make connections easier. Furthermore, UML
          diagram maybe is needed for our project as we need to separate clearly between the users’ range for each feature of our project. Besides, Dolby Atmos is required for the most realistic sound so that the user can enjoy fully the
          experiences.

          </div>
          <h2>6. Testing</h2>
          For this stage, we will be focusing on testing our project in order to find out bugs, run-time errors, physical errors, and glitches before we move on to any further implementation. First, we will do the software test, most of the
          compilers nowadays have debugged functions so this will not take long. The main problem here is the run-time errors, it is hard to find out and time-consuming. After this, we move to hardware testing. At this point, it is important for us
          to check that there are no redundant wires, no electrical leakages, and the headwear is suitable and comfortable with the wearer. After all, we will choose professional testers to wear this and experience this VR headset. Their job is to
          report back to us the feelings while wearing that headset, and any new errors. The next step for us is to carry on surveys and open a testing phase to a wider range. Besides, we will tell them to do some specific functions such as weird
          test cases, or even doing things when the Internet speed is super slow. However, they still can freely explore the new virtual world. More and more people who are interested in this headset can participate and give feedback. Lastly, we
          will fix and upgrade our project idea according to the feedback and the market trend.

          <!-- <div class="result-img-container"><img src="images/risk2.png" /></div> -->
          <h2>9. Group communication and processes</h2>
          Communication between teammates in a group is the most significant part while doing a team project. It is a fact that most of the failures happened because there was a misunderstanding in communication between people. Here, the main way
          that we talk to each other is through an online platform - Meeting in Microsoft Teams. We used this from the start of Assignment 2 until now, this is really helpful. Besides, we also use Messenger from Meta, Google Docs, Word, in order to
          save files and update, progress to each other. Regarding the frequency, our communication occurs at least once, and up to two times a week. In the meetings, we usually update our own processes to each other first, and then we start to
          talk about how well the overall report is. After that, we will discuss the unfinished parts and set fixed deadlines for them. This is to control the process and through this, we can easily keep track of everyone’s parts. In the upcoming
          week, which is week 12, we plan to have some offline meetings to practice our presentation as well as discuss some last parts of our Assignment 3 report.
          <br><br>
          If a group member does not interact with the team on a regular basis, we will try to meet and chat with them directly to see if they are having any challenges at work or in their personal lives. If they're having trouble finishing a
          task, the team will assist them in resolving the issue and assign them to a less challenging duty. However, if a team member is having personal troubles and continues to refuse to communicate or contribute to the team, we will have no
          choice but to reduce their contribution to 0% and report it to the lecturer.
