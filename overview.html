          <h2>Topic</h2>
          Continuing with the project idea from Assignment 2, our team has opted to further expand on the design of a Virtual Reality (VR) headset system. In order to create a virtual world in which users can freely communicate and interact with
          one another, the system would be made up of both hardware and software components. Furthermore, to make it more appealing to users, our VR system would also feature a variety of programs and tools that each user could personalize and
          select from based on their needs.
          <br>
          <br>
          For the VR headset to work properly, it must incorporate I/O devices such as the head-mounted display (HMD) which would go over your eyes to provide viewers with 3D visuals of the simulated environment. The HMD would employ gyroscopes
          to track and react to the user's head movements in order to adapt their viewpoint in real-time. In addition, headphones will be integrated with the headgear for simulating the dynamic audio from the virtual world so users can hear the
          sounds of their surroundings. Moreover, handheld controllers with haptic technology will be critical for the user to interact with the virtual space, allowing them to touch and feel artificial objects with realistic feedback. Most
          significantly, motion tracking sensors will be utilized to track the user's movement and replicate it digitally so they may feel as if they're actually moving around and getting a feeling of direction in the artificial landscape.
          <br>
          <br>
          The virtual environment that user will come across when they put on the VR headset will be the project's centerpiece. Our system's applications aren't just icons in a standard interface; they're built to seem like real buildings, with 3D
          graphics that mimic their real-life equivalents and staffed by AIs or avatars of real employees to provide users a more engaging experience when using them. The structures would then be situated around the main plaza area where users are
          spawned in after they joined, forming a town from which people could freely roam. These applications can be used for many purposes such as healthcare, education, office work, sports and entertainment, as well as design, retail shopping
          and travel. People will be able to access services and socialize with their friends or work with their coworkers more quickly and successfully with this VR system, as they will not be limited by the disadvantages of working from home.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          Due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, countries all across the world have implemented social distancing measures and restrictions in order to prevent the virus from spreading, forcing most of us to work and study from home without
          access to the services we are normally accustomed to. While some jobs may adapt better to this transition, many people have found remote working to be quite inconvenient because performance is lower when you’re working at home as people
          usually don’t have the technology from their workplace available to them, making some tasks longer to complete [1]. In addition, management and teamwork are more difficult for managers and employees alike as they must attend more online
          meetings to check up on each other tasks and the lack of direct interaction can make it harder for people to speak about their opinions and ideas. As a result, we wanted to take advantage of the applicability of current VR technology to
          develop a Virtual Reality headset system that would help resolve remote working issues. It would allow people to work, train, better visualize their products and tasks in a 3D environment with the assistance of readily available virtual
          tools.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Landscape</h2>
          As of now, there are various VR headsets available on the market for consumers to choose from such as the Oculus Quest 2, HTC Vive series, Sony PlayStation VR and Valve Index, … In terms of hardware, they all feature largely similar
          devices and sensors, with just slight differences in design and connection method. On the software front, most of these platforms have their own app stores, some even use software designed specifically for research and work purposes.
          However, rather than designing a basic interface screen for users to select which app to use, we would turn the apps into genuine 3D objects in a 3D environment that users can walk around and interact with, allowing them to interact with
          others face to face and enjoy a more immersive experience.
