						<h3>Nguyen Minh Quan</h3>
					</header>
					<p>About two months doing assignments in the team, I appreciate a lot not only for the other teammates’ contribution but also for the responsibilities of everyone while working as a team. Though we only met once a week, our overall processes were on the track most the time. Our communications, and the parts that were my tasks, I did them well. Talking about what can be improved, I think that will be about the way we come up with this project, as Mr. Long said, our project was too broad, we could not do the whole VR Headset but some functions inside it only. In this project, things that are stunning to me must be the way that how our teamwork, and the presentation. About the teamwork, everyone is really good , responsible and be on time for the deadlines of each section. Besides, Huy is the one who help me to construct and arrange my parts so that I can deliver the messages more clearly. When it comes to the presentation, honestly, this is the first presentation that I participate in as a first-semester student in university. At first, I thought that I would not make it but after all, I turned out that I demonstrate my section greatly and I finished my part in enough given time about 2-3 minutes. About the group, I had more time to develop about the teamworking. The meeting each week takes about 30 minutes and it is enough for us to discuss and check the report as well as the website. On the website, most of my commits are about build up the outlook and inserts the information for each section.</p>

						<h3>Nguyen Ngoc Duc Tri</h3>
					</header>
					<p>After being in team QTHD for more than half of the semester, I felt grateful to have met Quan, Huy and Duy. They’re all very ambitious, responsible and contributory teammates as they have worked really hard for Assignment 3 over the past weeks. Throughout the last 4 weeks, we have been making decent progress on the assignment. Despite our lack of regular meetings, we could still perform effective communication and keep on track with the plan we discussed before. As for our project idea, we were told by Mr. Long that we had a nice idea. However, the scope of the project was too big for a small team consisting of university students like us to make a VR headset for both hardware and software. Therefore, he advised us to focus more on the software part and we have tried to adjust its scale to make it seem affordable for our little team. Talking about our teamwork efficiency, all of my teammates were very responsible and they always ensured to complete the work before deadlines. Additionally, I also got a lot of help from them, and I truly appreciate it. For the presentation, in spite of our struggles in answering questions, overall, I felt like we still spoke well on our part, as we have spent two to three days practicing together. Once again, I am very grateful to meet and be a part of team QTHD and I’m looking forward to working with my teammates again in further courses.</p>

						<h3>Hua Nam Huy</h3>

					<p>As the course comes to an end, I must say that I've greatly enjoyed the time I've spent working with my teammates because they've all been extremely hardworking and meticulous in their work. Despite the fact that we didn't know much about each other at the outset, we were able to communicate effectively and comprehend each other's strengths and weaknesses throughout assignments 2 and 3. I was pleasantly surprised by how successfully we organized meetings and divided work among our team members, allowing us to accomplish all of our tasks on time. My teammates have all been wonderful to work together with Quan being a very active and social guy who was always eager to contribute, Tri proving to be a very responsible person and was always dedicated to his work and Duy as a senior student was very skillful and knowledgeable which helped us greatly with the report and the website design process. While I believe we performed well overall, some adjustments to the content of the final assignment could be made because the lecturer stated that our project scale was a little ambitious for a small team; therefore, I believe we could modify it so that the project is more manageable and realistic. To summarize, working with my teammates has been a fantastic experience that has taught me new skills in teamwork as well as how to produce an effective report. If I have the opportunity to work with my teammates again in future courses, I would be eager to do it.</p>

						<h3>Le Ngoc Duy</h3>
					</header>
					<p>After having spent over half of the semester working with this team, I still think highly of my teammates. They are very hardworking, ambitious, and always eager to learn more. Working with this team is an enjoyable process, as we are always communicating, always sharing our strengths, weaknesses as well as concerns so that we always have timely adjustments and give support to each other. Moreover, the meetings throughout the project were all held in time, and we all participated. The aspects that need improving are mostly related to the content of the assignment. As the comments from the lecturer had suggested, the team need to narrow down the scope in order to make the project more attainable and realistic. We are currently being too ambitious, and our scope are fairly broad to a point that there would be too much to be done. Altogether, working with the team had provided me valuable experiences with teamworking and taught me that when you’re working in a team, it is important to communicate with each other, to give support when needed, and that individuals should try their best with time management so as to not stall the overall progress of the team.</p>

						<h3>Group reflection</h3>
					</header>
					<p>While in Assignment 2, we could divide the workload separately and then meet after a certain amount of time to verify and discuss the new sections, in Assignment 3, we must collaborate with our teammates more because there are so many large elements such as Plans and Progresses, Risks, Skills, and Jobs. These parts necessitate not only collective effort but also each member's awareness of their role in order for us to communicate more effectively. We not only improve our teamwork skills, but we also learn a lot from one another. Because this is Quan and Tri's first semester, they have the opportunity to learn about HTML and some basic elements of web interfaces, as well as how to operate appropriately in a group assignment. In addition, Huy and Duy are actually the seniors, so this is an opportunity for them to practicing their leading skills and also revising some of their knowledges. Our presentation went well, but we did not have enough time to update the internal content based on the feedback from Assignment 2, thus we received some criticisms from our lecturer, confusing some of the listeners. Next, everyone seemed to have a lot more deadlines from other courses, which caused us to miss deadlines and have to remind each other. After all, experiencing challenges in a group is normal, and it is our responsibility to deal with them and assist others in overcoming them so that we may come up with the greatest answer for our report and website. Furthermore, after hearing Mr. Long's input, we tried our hardest to improve and replace some of the material so that our project will be more focused on software than hardware, and our overall goal is only a virtual environment with some features inside the software. To summarize, having troubles in a group is unavoidable, and all we can do is help each other to overcome them. We are proud of each other after two months of working together in this group.</p>
