						<h3>Nguyen Minh Quan</h3>
					</header>
					<p>About two months doing assignments in the team, I appreciate a lot not only for the other teammates’ contribution but also for the responsibilities of everyone while working as a team. Though we only met once a week, our overall processes were on the track most the time. Our communications, and the parts that were my tasks, I did them well. Talking about what can be improved, I think that will be about the way we come up with this project, as Mr. Long said, our project was too broad, we could not do the whole VR Headset but some functions inside it only. In this project, things that are stunning to me must be the way that how our teamwork, and the presentation. About the teamwork, everyone is really good , responsible and be on time for the deadlines of each section. Besides, Huy is the one who help me to construct and arrange my parts so that I can deliver the messages more clearly. When it comes to the presentation, honestly, this is the first presentation that I participate in as a first-semester student in university. At first, I thought that I would not make it but after all, I turned out that I demonstrate my section greatly and I finished my part in enough given time about 2-3 minutes. About the group, I had more time to develop about the teamworking. The meeting each week takes about 30 minutes and it is enough for us to discuss and check the report as well as the website. On the website, most of my commits are about build up the outlook and inserts the information for each section.</p>

						<h3>Nguyen Ngoc Duc Tri</h3>
					</header>
					<p>After being in team QTHD for more than half of the semester, I felt grateful to have met Quan, Huy and Duy. They’re all very ambitious, responsible and contributory teammates as they have worked really hard for Assignment 3 over the past weeks. Throughout the last 4 weeks, we have been making decent progress on the assignment. Despite our lack of regular meetings, we could still perform effective communication and keep on track with the plan we discussed before. As for our project idea, we were told by Mr. Long that we had a nice idea. However, the scope of the project was too big for a small team consisting of university students like us to make a VR headset for both hardware and software. Therefore, he advised us to focus more on the software part and we have tried to adjust its scale to make it seem affordable for our little team. Talking about our teamwork efficiency, all of my teammates were very responsible and they always ensured to complete the work before deadlines. Additionally, I also got a lot of help from them, and I truly appreciate it. For the presentation, in spite of our struggles in answering questions, overall, I felt like we still spoke well on our part, as we have spent two to three days practicing together. Once again, I am very grateful to meet and be a part of team QTHD and I’m looking forward to working with my teammates again in further courses.</p>
