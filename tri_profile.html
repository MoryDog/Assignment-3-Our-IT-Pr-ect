                    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>My name is Nguyen Ngoc Duc Tri. You can find me with my student ID: s3926650 or my email address: s3926650@rmit.edu.vn. I was born in Ho Chi Minh City on September 17th, 2003, which means I’m 18 years old now. I’ve been learning English
                        non-stop for the past 12 academic years and recently, I’m studying Chinese to expand my language skills, as well as getting to know more about the Chinese culture. I think I’m the kind of person that is always motivated to dig
                        deeper into things that are new to me, or what I love to do, such as coding, technology, which has then led me to the world of IT. I enjoy playing sports like badminton and ping pong, yet due to my eye issues, I’m not allowed to
                        play sports anymore, which frustrated me a lot. I love playing video games, however, I’m also very interested in how the games are made since the first time I played them, which aroused my dream of becoming a Game Developer. When
                        I first played video games, I realized that not only did I want to play them, but I would like to make a game of my own too. Therefore, I started to research how a game is made. There are many elements, but one of them had sparked
                        up my interest in IT: Coding and programming languages like C++, Javascript, C#, etc. Until now, I’ve learned through the basics of Pascal, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. In addition to the valuable lectures and tutorials
                        throughout the courses, I expect to improve and gain more experience in teamwork, programming logic, knowledge in IT, as well as making new friends, seeking chances to interact with professional IT experts, and learn as much as
                        I could from them. </p>

                    <h2>My thoughs about the test results</h2>
                    <p class="description-content">
                        For me, the results of these tests reflect my personality, and my attitude when dealing with certain situations. However, not everything in these test results is correct about me. For example, I actually think a lot before doing something rather than
                        just doing it emotionally. Therefore, I don’t see them as my actual person. On the other hand, some factors truly show what I am right now, and I appreciated having recognized them. As can be seen from the result, I’m an introverted
                        person, and for me, this is not good at all when forming a team. Since I feel uncomfortable communicating with other teammates, it would be annoying and reduce the whole team’s productivity and outcomes in some worse scenarios.
                        I’ll carefully take a look at myself again, and then try my best to improve, especially my communication and group-working skills.

                    <h3>Job description </h2>
                        <p class="description-content">
                            For this job, the employee is responsible for creating games using Unity Engine – a popular game engine, widely used around the world. He is also in charge of operating the company’s developing application: App game, as well as building developing environments
                            like: test server for testers to check for gameplays, bugs, and so on; application servers/hosts for managing and manipulating sources of data in the games. Another requirement for the employee is performing optimization to
                            the servers to minimize update and maintenance tasks. Based on my understandings, this is done to cut off the expenses and reduce the rate of bugs appearing. Additionally, server optimization also aims to decrease overload
                            while operating the system to improve the user experience. Finally, taking serious consideration into user feedback to improve the products’ quality is a critical aspect for this job. What interests me from this position is
                            the chance of developing games using Unity Engin, along with developing application servers. These are all the factors that I’ve been very curious about and researched a lot on them, as I look forward to working more with them
                            in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Job requirements </h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Experienced in developing mobile or PC games.</li>
                                <li>Experienced in developing games using Unity Engine, along with proper knowledge of a programming language: C#.</li>
                                <li>Good communication skills.</li>
                                <li>Perform a wide knowledge of: 3D Graphics, Shader Programs, Python, Go language (Web application development), and building systems suitable for large-scale access.</li>
                                <li>Experience in Game Design, cartoons, and games.</li>
                                <li>Good use of English in work. Knowing Japanese is a huge plus.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Current skills </h2>
                                <p class="description-content">
                                    For now, I have gone through the basics of Unity, C#, and Python. I also have adequate communication, teamwork, and research skills, along with some knowledge in the game industry. However, none of these is at an advanced or well-trained level yet. Moreover,
                                    I haven’t got any experience in many factors such as 3D Graphics, server development, additional programming languages, and Game Design.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Future development plan</h2>
                                <p class="description-content">
                                    I plan to improve my skills in Unity and programming languages by studying courses inside and outside RMIT, as well as seeking projects for practical experience. They can also help me with my communication and teamwork when it comes to team projects.
                                    Additionally, throughout subjects in RMIT, I will increase my knowledge in professional factors like Game Design or 3D Graphics, with the help of the lecturers and professors. Finally, I tend to start learning Japanese
                                    in the third year of university, as I need to finish studying Chinese first, and I expect to speak and use Japanese fluently in the next two, three years.
