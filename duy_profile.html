          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p class="description-content">
            My name is Le Ngoc Duy, my student number is s3757327, and my email address is s3757327@rmit.edu.vn. I was born and
            raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The diversity in the culture of our nation has always been an interest of mine. I
            love to travel, explore new places, meet new people, and learn new things. Apart from that, I enjoy exercising in my
            free time. My first interest in IT began when I was a young kid. When I was younger, I played a lot of games on the
            computers at home. While I was playing them, I could not help but wonder how all of this works. Questions like how such
            a small device can contain so many things, and how we can do so much with computers were also sparked my interest. Along
            with playing video games, I frequently watched TV as a kid. There were many channels that broadcasted movies and
            documentaries which showcased the power of computers and programmers, moreover, they also showed how programs were being
            used for manufacturing lines that implemented automation technologies. Those were the starting point that set me of on
            this journey. I expect to have strong core knowledge of IT in all aspects such as coding skills, problem analysis,
            problem-solving, teamwork, time management, handling conflicts, etc. During the time of my studies, I would also like to
            enjoy an abundance of extracurricular activities that RMIT is providing. One of which is the vast number of clubs that
            are operating within RMIT. This will give me the opportunity to make new friends and further broaden my knowledge beyond
            my major.

          <h2>My thought about the results</h2>
          <p class="description-content">
              The results from the three tests above provided a very interesting view of my personality and preferences that even I am
            not aware of. they give accurate suggestions for me to make better decisions career-wise Moreover, I get to know my
            strengths and weaknesses better so that I can plan my studies accordingly to maximize my strengths and improve my
            weaknesses. Given the results that I received, I know what kinds of behavior and action can be beneficial to the team,
            in terms of increasing efficiency, performance. But I would say that it will not greatly influence my behavior because I
            will likely be true to myself and express my truest self to others.
