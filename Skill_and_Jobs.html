					<p>As mentioned above, our main focus will be the software of the system, therefore, we will only hire one member to deal with the hardware
            like wiring, checking blueprints, validities, comfortable for the wearers. The other three slots will be extremely focus on the software
            in order to deliver the best virtual environment for the users.</p>

					<p>In this position, the worker will be using materials, components from existing devices to base our
             own hardware on and modify it to suit the software. After that, they will be testing the hardware
             functionality and users comfortability when wearing the headset.</p>

						<h3>Software Engineer</h3>

					<p>The Software Engineer will be in charge of building Artificial Intelligence prototypes.
             For example, the chatterbots within the starting screen or some in the Heath Care building, they will act as
              the virtual assistant so that we will need a professional with experiences in this field.
              In detail, they will need to use platforms such as API.ai and Amazon Lambda to build the foundations of
               our AI assistants. [4]</p>

						<h3>Backend Developer</h3>

					<p>The main objective of the backend developer is handling the interaction between the user and the virtual world,
             which will mostly consist of moving around within the virtual world. So, skills and knowledge regarding VR locomotion
             are needed. Moreover, this position required the fundamentals of programming such as Oriented-Object Analyze, Design, and Programming
              as well as master in many programming languages such as Python, Java, C++ so that they can create the most functional and useful features in our system.</p>

						<h3>UI Graphic Designer </h3>
					</header>
					<p>As mentioned in the previous parts of the project, the virtual, 3D world will be created mostly by using Blender and Unity.
            So, it is important that individuals who are working in this part of the project to have sufficient skills in 3D modeling.
            Skills such as shading and lightning, texturing, meshing, etc. must be fairly adequate. Moreover, the individual must also
            be good at coming up with architecturally and aesthetically pleasing designs that can gain the attention of users. </p>

					<p>For all of those positions that we mentioned above, we expect them to have some soft skills such as team working or logical thinking.
             These skills are important for everyone in the working environment, they not only help the employees to clearly understand the situation
             but also increase the working progresses outcome. Moreover, our team, as the leaders of these people, must have skills such as people management,
              relationship-building, risk-taking as well as creativity and positivity [5] so we can have a professional working environment.</p>
